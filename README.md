# AppearanceCollectionTooltip
## A World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic AddOn

This AddOn adds a line to item tooltips which displays information about their appearance.  
Specifically whether this appearance has been collected, has not been collected but is collectable or not collectable on the current character.

'Collected' in green means the item's appearance is in your collection.  
'Not collected' in yellow means the item's appearance is not in your collection, but is collectable by your current character.  
'Not collected' in red means the item's appearance is neither in your collection nor collectable by your current character.
