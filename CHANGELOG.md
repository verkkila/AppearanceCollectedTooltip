### 1.0.6

Added PvP item information into T4, T5 and T6 tier token tooltips. Note that for T6 non-set pieces (i.e. wrist, waist and feet) the PvP item  
whose information is displayed is that which matches the PvP set in appearance, e.g. Vindicator's Chain for Hunters.

### 1.0.5

Fixed an issue where tier token collection status would not display for non-English clients.
Added reasoning for non-collectible tier tokens (i.e. of the wrong class) for consistency.

### 1.0.4

Fixed an issue where collected items would not show as such when the character is ineligible to collect them.

### 1.0.3

Increased verbosity in tooltips
Fixed a bug where certain items would show as collectable when the appearance is already collected

### 1.0.2

Support for T7 and T8 tokens.

### 1.0.1

Add support for tier tokens from TBC (raid tiers 4,5, and 6).

### 1.0.0

Initial release
